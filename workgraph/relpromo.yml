#Release Tasks = relpromo
#
#  pushes a task graph
#  reuse existing binaries from CI
#  create l10n repacks - done via BBB, needs to be ported after Callek finishes **
#  port partner repacks - done via BBB, currently on mac workers
#    both l10n and partner need a pool of macosx workers, or to port to do cross-compile **
#    (windows partner repacks will rework on linux)
#  funsize stuff runs in docker-worker
#  update-verification needs to run on testers
#    port for mac and for windows **
#  source tarballs, etc. runs in docker-worker
#  bouncer client -- requires VPN access to cloudops amz account **
#    solve with scriptworker
#  bumper to bump in-tree fx version - can use common infra with periodic updates **
#    solve with same scriptowrker as periodic updates
#
#Scriptworker deployment??

#manual-nightly-test = whimboo stuff, but done in a project branch
