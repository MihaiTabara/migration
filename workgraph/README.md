# TODO

## Work Item Attributes

 * duration? (in person-days, not used to calculate ETAs)
 * ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ item
 * "etc." to indicate there will be more dependencies

## Implementation stuff

 * per-file defaults
 * subgraphs for milestones?
 * other outputs:
   * enumerate items with no deps, sorted by the maximum path length (or duration) from that item
   * predicted completion for each milestone assuming maximum parallelization
   * a few rooted graphs, one for each milestone
