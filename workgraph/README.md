# TODO

## Implementation stuff

 * change comments to a description attribute
 * graph features:
   * milestones, external, tbd shown in different shapes
   * done in different colors
   * scale based on duration?
 * other outputs:
   * enumerate items with no deps, sorted by the maximum path length (or total duration) from that item
   * per (selected) milestone:
    * percent completed, predicted completion based on FTE count
    * rooted graph of dependencies
